SC2Reader User Manual
=========================

Thanks for choosing sc2reader for your Starcraft analysis needs.

There is a pressing need in the SC2 community for better statistics, better
analytics, better tools for organizing and searching replays. Better websites
for sharing replays and hosting tournaments. These tools can't be created with
out first being able to open up replay files and analyse the content within.
That's why SC2Reader was built, to provide a solid foundation on which the next
generation of tools and websites can be built and benefit the community.

So lets get you started right away! Through the linked tutorials and reference
pages below we'll get you started building your own tools and systems in no
time. Any questions, suggestions, or concerns should be posted to the sc2reader
`mailing list`_. You can also pop on to our #sc2reader, our `IRC channel`_ on
Freenode if you want to chat or need some live support.
